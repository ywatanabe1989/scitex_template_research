\textbf{Time-dependent, pre-ictal PAC features}\\
\smallskip
\textbf{A.} Z-scores of PAC comodulograms against surrogate data over time, triggered to seizure onsets.
\textbf{B.} Seventeen descriptive metrics of PAC calculations; shaded lines show median ± IQR and raw values as lines.
\textbf{C.} Effect sizes of Brunner-Munzel tests comparing Ashman's D (bimodality metric) between seizure and control groups across time windows. Red dotted lines show linear fits to effect sizes in the time window [-1024, 0) minutes from seizure onset, with R² values indicating goodness of fit.
