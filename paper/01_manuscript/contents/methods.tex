%% ============================================================
%% METHODS STRUCTURE GUIDE:
%% ============================================================
%% The Methods section should provide sufficient detail for replication
%% Organize logically with clear subsections
%% Common subsections include:
%%   - Ethics/IRB approval
%%   - Dataset/Participants/Materials
%%   - Experimental design
%%   - Data acquisition
%%   - Data processing
%%   - Statistical analysis
%%   - Software and tools
%% ============================================================

\subsection{Ethics}
% Describe ethical approval, informed consent, and compliance
% Example: This study was conducted under ethical approval from [Institution]
% IRB (Protocol #[number]). All participants provided written informed consent.

[Describe your ethics approval and consent procedures here]

\subsection{Dataset and Study Design}
% Describe your dataset, participants, or experimental system
% Include: Sample size, inclusion/exclusion criteria, key characteristics
% Provide citations for publicly available datasets

% Example structure:
% The [dataset name] comprises [description] from [N] participants/samples.
% Data were acquired through [method] with [specifications]. Signals were
% sampled at [rate] Hz with [resolution]-bit resolution.

[Describe your dataset, study design, and data acquisition here]

\subsection{Data Processing}
% Describe preprocessing steps, filtering, normalization, etc.
% Be specific about parameters and software used

% Example:
% Data preprocessing included [step 1], [step 2], and [step 3].
% [Specific method] was applied using [parameters].

[Describe your data processing pipeline here]

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
% If applicable, describe how you extracted features from your data
% Include mathematical formulations for key methods

% Example:
% We extracted [N] features capturing [characteristics]:
% Feature 1: [description and formula]
% Feature 2: [description and formula]

[Describe your feature extraction methods here]

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
% Describe statistical tests, significance thresholds, corrections for multiple comparisons
% Example: We used [test name] to compare [groups]. Significance threshold was
% set at p < 0.05 with [correction method] correction for multiple comparisons.

[Describe your statistical analysis methods here]

\subsection{Machine Learning Methods}
% If applicable, describe your ML pipeline
% Include: Algorithm selection, training/testing split, cross-validation, hyperparameters

% Example:
% We trained [algorithm] models using [training approach]. Models were evaluated
% using [metrics] with [validation strategy].

[Describe your machine learning methods here if applicable]

\subsection{Software and Reproducibility}
% List key software, packages, versions used
% Describe measures taken to ensure reproducibility

% Example:
% All analyses were performed using Python 3.x with NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
% Code is available at [repository URL]. Random seeds were fixed at [value] for
% complete reproducibility.
