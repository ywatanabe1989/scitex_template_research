# Quick Start Guide for SciTeX Writer Template

## What is This?

This directory contains a complete template for writing scientific research manuscripts. All `.tex` files include:
- **Structure guides** explaining what to write in each section
- **Examples** showing effective formatting
- **Placeholders** (in `[brackets]`) that you should replace with your content

## Getting Started (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Update Metadata (5 minutes)

Navigate to `shared/` and edit these files:

```bash
# Your paper title
vim shared/title.tex

# Author names and affiliations
vim shared/authors.tex

# 3-6 keywords for your paper
vim shared/keywords.tex

# Target journal
vim shared/journal_name.tex
```

### Step 2: Write Your Abstract (30-60 minutes)

Edit `01_manuscript/contents/abstract.tex`:
- Follow the 7-part structure in the comments
- Keep it 150-300 words
- Include specific quantitative results
- Write as one continuous paragraph

### Step 3: Fill in Main Sections (varies)

Edit these files in `01_manuscript/contents/`:

```bash
# Background and objectives (1000-2000 words)
vim introduction.tex

# Reproducible procedures (1000-2000 words)
vim methods.tex

# Findings with figures/tables (varies)
vim results.tex

# Interpretation and implications (1000-2000 words)
vim discussion.tex
```

Each file contains:
- **Detailed instructions** at the top (in comments)
- **Section templates** showing what to write
- **Placeholder text** to replace

### Step 4: Add Supporting Content

```bash
# 3-5 bullet points (85 chars each)
vim 01_manuscript/contents/highlights.tex

# Data and code availability
vim 01_manuscript/contents/data_availability.tex
```

### Step 5: Add Figures, Tables, and References

```bash
# Add your figure files (.png, .jpg, .mmd)
cp your_figures/* 01_manuscript/contents/figures/caption_and_media/

# Add your table files (.xlsx, .csv)
cp your_tables/* 01_manuscript/contents/tables/caption_and_media/

# Update bibliography
vim shared/bib_files/bibliography.bib
```

## Compiling Your Manuscript

```bash
# Compile manuscript
./compile

# Compile in watch mode (auto-recompile on changes)
./compile -m -w

# Your PDF will be at:
# 01_manuscript/manuscript.pdf
```

## Understanding the Template Structure

### Abstract Structure (7 parts)
1. **Basic Introduction**: Introduce the field broadly
2. **Detailed Background**: Provide context for specialists
3. **General Problem**: State what's unknown/lacking
4. **Main Result**: "Here we show that..."
5. **Results with Comparisons**: Specific findings vs. prior work
6. **General Context**: Broader significance
7. **Broader Perspective**: Future impact (optional)

### Introduction Structure (6 paragraphs)
1. **Problem Statement**: Importance and impact
2. **Current Knowledge**: What's known, with citations
3. **Knowledge Gap**: What's missing or limited
4. **Your Approach**: Your method and its advantages
5. **Objectives**: Hypotheses and specific aims
6. **Preview** (optional): Brief summary of main results

### Methods Structure
- **Ethics**: IRB approval, consent
- **Dataset/Study Design**: Data source, sample size
- **Data Processing**: Preprocessing steps
- **Feature Extraction**: How you derived features
- **Statistical Analysis**: Tests and significance thresholds
- **ML Methods** (if applicable): Algorithms and validation
- **Software**: Tools used, reproducibility measures

### Results Structure
- **Dataset Characteristics**: Sample properties with stats
- **Main Findings**: Primary results organized by topic
- **Performance/Validation**: Model performance metrics
- **Additional Analyses**: Secondary findings

### Discussion Structure (8 paragraphs)
1. **Summary**: Restate key findings
2-3. **Interpretation**: Compare with literature, explain mechanisms
4. **Strengths**: What makes your study unique
5. **Limitations**: Honest acknowledgment
6. **Implications**: Practical and theoretical impact
7. **Future Directions**: Next steps and open questions
8. **Conclusion**: Strong closing statement

## Tips for Success

### Writing Style
- **Tense**:
  - Present tense for general facts (supported by multiple studies)
  - Past tense for specific prior studies
  - Past tense for your results
- **Specificity**: Always include numbers (e.g., "increased by 23%" not "increased")
- **Clarity**: Use technical terms but spell out acronyms on first use
- **Flow**: Use transition phrases between paragraphs

### Using the Templates
- **Read the guides first**: Understand the structure before writing
- **Replace placeholders**: Search for `[` to find all placeholders
- **Keep or remove guides**: Keep commented sections for reference or delete after reading
- **Follow examples**: The example structures show effective patterns

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå Leaving placeholder text like `[Your Title]` in final version
- ‚ùå Ignoring the structure guides
- ‚ùå Writing in wrong tense (e.g., present tense for your specific results)
- ‚ùå Forgetting to add quantitative details
- ‚ùå Not citing prior work appropriately

## Getting Help

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Overview and compilation instructions
- `docs/TEMPLATE_CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed change log
- Each `.tex` file - Inline instructions and examples

### Troubleshooting
- **Compilation errors**: Check `01_manuscript/logs/` for error messages
- **Missing commands**: The compilation system uses containers, it will auto-download needed tools
- **Format questions**: Check the comments in each `.tex` file for guidance

## Example Workflow

1. **Day 1**: Update metadata, draft abstract structure
2. **Day 2-3**: Write introduction (background, gaps, objectives)
3. **Day 4-5**: Write methods (detailed procedures)
4. **Day 6-8**: Write results (findings with figures/tables)
5. **Day 9-10**: Write discussion (interpretation, implications)
6. **Day 11**: Polish abstract, write highlights, data availability
7. **Day 12**: Final review, compile, check PDF
8. **Day 13+**: Iterate based on co-author feedback

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Read this guide
2. ‚úÖ Update metadata files
3. ‚úÖ Start with abstract (it helps clarify your message)
4. ‚úÖ Work through sections systematically
5. ‚úÖ Compile frequently to check formatting
6. ‚úÖ Get feedback from colleagues
7. ‚úÖ Polish and submit!

**Remember**: Good scientific writing is iterative. Don't expect perfection on the first draft. Use this template as a scaffold to organize your thoughts, then refine through multiple passes.

Good luck with your manuscript! üéìüìù
